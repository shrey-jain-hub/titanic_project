# titanic_project


## Project Overview
This project focuses on conducting an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Titanic dataset. The goal is to extract meaningful insights about the passengers and their survival outcomes through various statistical methods and visual representations.

## Project Structure
- Data Import
- Summary of Data
- Analysis of Missing Values
- Data Visualizations
- Correlation Insights
- Key Findings

## Prerequisites
To execute this project, you will need the following Python libraries:
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- numpy

You can install the necessary libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy
```

## Data Import
The Titanic dataset is imported from a CSV file:
```python
titanic_data = pd.read_csv('/content/drive/MyDrive/data/train.csv')
```

## Summary of Data
The initial rows of the dataset and a comprehensive summary of its structure are displayed using:
```python
print(titanic_data.head())
print(titanic_data.info())
print(titanic_data.describe())
```

## Analysis of Missing Values
The analysis identifies missing values within the dataset and visualizes them using a heatmap:
```python
sns.heatmap(titanic_data.isnull(), cbar=False, cmap='viridis')
```

## Data Visualizations
A variety of visualizations are created to enhance understanding of the dataset:
- Histograms for numerical attributes
- Boxplots for Age and Fare distributions
- Pairplot to explore relationships among features

## Correlation Insights
A correlation matrix is computed and visualized to highlight relationships between numerical variables:
```python
correlation_matrix = titanic_data[numeric_cols].corr()
sns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=True, fmt='.2f', cmap='coolwarm')
```

## Key Findings
The analysis yields several important observations:
1. A significant portion of passengers did not survive.
2. Missing values are present in the Age and Cabin columns.
3. The distribution of Fare is right-skewed.
4. A strong correlation exists between Pclass and survival rates.
5. Age and Fare also exhibit some correlation with survival.

## Output
The key findings from the analysis are documented in a text file named `titanic_eda_report.txt`.
